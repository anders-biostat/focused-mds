Description: focusedMDS takes a distance matrix and plots it as an 
    interactive graph. Double click on any point to choose a new focus
    point, and hover over points to see their ID labels. In this graph,
    one point is focused on at the center of the graph. All other 
    points are plotted around this central point at their exact 
    distances to the point, as given in the distance matrix. In other 
    words, the distance between each point and the focus point are the
    true distances given in the distance matrix. The non focus points
    are plotted with respect to each other as exactly as possible. For
    more details, see https://lea-urpa.github.io/focusedMDS.html.

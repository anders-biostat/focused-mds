<h1>Focused Multidimensional Scaling</h1>
<p>Data visualization is a key tool in understanding real relationships among data within a dataset. Current static tools for visualization of data from distance matrices via multidimensional scaling can be misleading. Therefore we have developed a new interactive multidimensional scaling method that better represents the real relationships among data in a distance matrix, focused multidimensional scaling. </p>
<p>In focused multidimensional scaling, the user chooses a particular data point (the focus), around which all other points are plotted in their exact distances to the focus as given in the distance matrix. The distances of the non-focus points are then plotted as close to their ideal distances as possible. The user can choose another focus, and the graph will rearrange to reflect the distances to the new focus.</p>
